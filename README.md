# UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING COURSEWORK

*"Every plant contains a bioelectrical activity directly influenced by the environment and their species. It plays an important part in a plant’s physiological activities and is referred to by some scientists as the “main transmission route in the stems of higher plants”* 


## About the project
The goal is to create a ‘’personality” for each plant in the greenhouse. This will be determined by the gathered electrical activity.

By combining an electromagnetic sensor and an ECG module, we want to record the action potential in a higher plant (higher plant definition). This is referred to as extracellular technique which focuses on non-invasive data gathering. We want to enhance the system by sensing motion around the plant and function as a triggered for the output.
